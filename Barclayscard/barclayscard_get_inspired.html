                    <h2><span>Joi Gordon, CEO, Dress for Success Worldwide</span></h2>
                    <p class="description">When I graduated from college, I began my career in the legal profession as an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, New York. The job was the means to an end to gain experience in litigation and, while the cases were interesting, I found myself wanting to be more inspired by my daily work.</p>

                <div class="toggle-text">
                    <p>During that time, I was introduced to Dress for Success just shortly after it opened its doors, a non-profit organization that at the time was popularly known for providing interview suits to low-income women.  Soon after Dress for Success was founded, it came to recognize that finding a job is only one step in a woman's journey towards economic independence and that remaining employed and building a rewarding career is essential if a woman is to become self-sufficient. <br/><br/>I wanted to get involved, so I joined its Board of Directors. As I became more and more involved, I realized the experience held a great deal of purpose for me. I no longer wanted to be responsible for putting women behind bars; I wanted to be the one that helped get them ahead of the game, so that they could have prosperous futures, stable families and create deeper ties to their communities.  <br/><br/>So I decided to leave the courtroom and build on my experience in the boardroom, becoming the executive director of Dress for Success’ New York program in 1999. <br/><br/>My change in careers was definitely a cause for concern for some, but I soon realized that other people’s perceptions didn’t have to be my own. <br/><br/>I think it’s important for women to find within themselves their own inner motivations. I’ve always believed whether it’s joining boards or getting involved with an organization in some other capacity—if you don’t try, you’ll never know what winning might feel like.</p>

                    <p>It’s a well-known fact you will need to invest 3 things when being an entrepreneur. Your time, your energy and… your money. There is one investment that will yield you an immediate return. You. The reality is, you will never work harder and earn less than when you are starting your own business. As an entrepreneur, your two most precious commodities are time and money. Building a business without a clear vision and action plan is a waste of … you got it… time and money. You were not put on this planet to be everything to everyone. You were put on this planet to deliver great value with the support of a knowledgeable and powerful team. <br/><br/>There are a few tips that you can use as a guide to running your own business (see the Tips section below to read the details).

                    <p class="description">Specifically as a woman, it’s hard to find time to deal with your money when you’re juggling work, family, friends and the all-too-often-forgotten personal time. It can be overwhelming to be paying bills, commuting, working and dealing with everything around the house. I’ve sometimes let my own finances slip, whether it’s missing a credit card payment when I was sick, forgetting to pay a bill when traveling abroad or catching a stolen card a little bit too late. </p>

Between losing your credit card, using an unsecure network and even swiping your card at a major retailer, there are plenty of chances to have your identity stolen. Outside of just avoiding the worst case of identity theft, setting up a system for your finances can have far more benefits. <br/><br/>By exercising good money management skills, investing upfront time understanding finances and simply automating and double checking your payments, you will gain peace of mind, save precious time and gain control so you can easily avoid common mistakes that have a big impact.</p>

Don’t even try.”<br/><br/>That’s what my husband and I said when we looked at our debt in 2011 and realized what little progress we had been making each year as we paid the minimum payments. Something had to change, or that big $79,000 lump would always be there.</p>

                    <p>“We did it.”<br/><br/>That’s what we can say now in 2014. Now that debt lump is gone and instead there’s money filling an emergency fund. We made one big change--we took each paycheck and put a significant amount towards the debt first, then lived off the remainder. That commitment turned the tide for us by changing our outlook and really impacting the debt. We made lots of little changes, too--reducing our expenses in every budget category, earning extra money selling household items and babysitting, and putting off any unnecessary spending. Every dollar saved or earned went towards the debt.<br/><br/>Can you do it? <br/><br/>Yes, you can. You can release yourself from the hold that debt has on you. Each time a paycheck comes, it can be your money instead of being sent away towards debt. Every little (and big) effort reduces the debt. It will be difficult, but it will be worth it.<br/><br/>- <a href="http://www.moneywisemoms.com/" target="_blank">MoneywiseMoms.com</a></p>

                <p>Don’t limit yourself, and don’t assume that whatever degree you’ve gotten needs to direct where you go next. If I hadn't gone to law school to be a lawyer, I probably wouldn’t have seen the door opening at Dress for Success.

                <h5>Build Strong Networks</h5>
                <p>Build strong networks—both formal and informal. Be conscious of the image you’re projecting on platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook. You want to be remembered for the right reasons, so be cautious. Social media is part of your life and it’s hard to scrub the slate clean. That’s something I tell my daughter almost every single day.</p>

                <h5>Negotiate Your Salary</h5>
                <p>Here are some strategies to start with:<br/><br/>
                    - Check how much people in your industry and in similar positions with equivalent knowledge and experience are making. If you want to negotiate from a position of strength, it is critical to know where you stand in relation to your peers.</p>
                   <p> - Learn how to talk about your achievements in relation to how they affect your company’s bottom line. Whenever possible use numbers to quantify your accomplishments.</p>
                   <p> - Anticipate questions that your boss will ask and work from a win-win perspective. What’s important to your manager? Why do they need you? What is the current demand for your position in the market? Women are particularly well attuned to the needs of others. Leverage this advantage!</p>
